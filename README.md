## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- MongoDB 5+
- npm or yarn

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd tally_backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   # Database Configuration
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/tally_elections
   
   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
   
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   
   # Frontend URL (for CORS and URL generation)
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   
   # Voter Key Encryption (CRITICAL: Change in production!)
   VOTER_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-super-secure-32-character-encryption-key
   
   # Optional: IPFS Configuration (for vote metadata)
   IPFS_GATEWAY=https://ipfs.io/ipfs/
   IPFS_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
   
   # Optional: Blockchain Configuration
   ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-project-id
   ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-for-deployment
   ```

   **Important**: 
   - `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Strong secret key for JWT signing (change in production!)
   - `VOTER_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: 32-character encryption key for voter keys (change in production!)
   - `FRONTEND_URL`: Must match your frontend URL for CORS to work
   - `PORT`: Backend server port (frontend will connect to this)

3. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Start MongoDB (if running locally)
   mongod
   
   # Or use Docker
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # Development mode
   npm run dev
   
   # Production build
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
